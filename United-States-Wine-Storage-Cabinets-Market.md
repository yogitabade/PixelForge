As customers become more knowledgeable about wine, they expect restaurants to offer well-preserved, premium selections. This has led to an increased investment in wine storage infrastructure. Additionally, with a focus on premium service, restaurants are looking for storage solutions that not only preserve wine but also contribute to the overall ambiance and customer experience. Consequently, the restaurants segment is expected to continue growing as wine becomes an integral part of the dining experience.</p><h2>Hotels Segment</h2><p>Hotels are increasingly incorporating wine storage cabinets to cater to the growing demand for premium amenities and services. High-end hotels and resorts, in particular, are investing in wine storage solutions to offer guests an enhanced experience.

The rise of luxury and boutique hotels, which often emphasize unique and personalized guest experiences, has further driven the demand for high-end, stylish wine storage cabinets that align with the hotels’ brand image and customer expectations.
